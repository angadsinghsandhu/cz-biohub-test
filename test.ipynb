    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Allocate an Interactive Job on a Compute Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Since HPC clusters typically don’t allow you to run long‐term services on the login node, you first need to allocate a compute node using Slurm. For example, on the login node you might run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "salloc -N 1 -p [your_partition] -t 01:00:00\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command gives you an interactive session on a compute node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Launch a Jupyter Server on the Compute Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’re on the compute node (you can confirm by checking the hostname), load any required modules (e.g., Python) and start a Jupyter Notebook server without opening a browser, specifying a port (say, 8888):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module load python/3.8  # or whichever version you need\n",
    "jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The server will output a URL with a token (e.g., `http://localhost:8888/?token=...`). Keep this token handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Set Up SSH Port Forwarding\n",
    "\n",
    "Because compute nodes are usually not directly accessible from your local machine, you need to forward the compute node’s port through the login node. Since you’re already using VS Code Remote SSH, you can open an additional terminal on your local machine (or in VS Code) and run a tunnel command from the login node. For example, on your local machine run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh -N -L 8888:<compute_node_hostname>:8888 your_username@<login_node_address>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `<compute_node_hostname>` with the name or IP of the compute node (as seen from the login node) and `<login_node_address>` with your login node’s address.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* In some HPC setups, you might need a two-step tunneling (first to the login node, then from login node to compute node). Check your system’s documentation or ask your sysadmin if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Connect from VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the tunnel is active, you have a secure channel from your local machine (or VS Code remote session) to the compute node’s Jupyter server. In VS Code’s Jupyter extension (or in your browser), open the URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:8888/?token=YOUR_TOKEN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This connects your notebook interface to the kernel running on the compute node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Additional Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VS Code Jupyter Extension:**  \n",
    "  VS Code can connect to a remote Jupyter server. In the command palette, search for “Jupyter: Specify local or remote Jupyter server for connections” and enter your tunneled URL. This allows you to run cells from your ipynb file while the actual kernel executes on the compute node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HPC Policies:**  \n",
    "  Some systems restrict direct port forwarding or require you to use a proxy. Consult your HPC documentation or administrators for specific instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Scheduling:**  \n",
    "  For longer running notebooks, you might consider submitting your job via a batch script that starts a Jupyter server. When using interactive jobs (via `salloc`), remember that your session will eventually timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Allocate a compute node** with an interactive Slurm job.\n",
    "2. **Start the Jupyter server** on that compute node.\n",
    "3. **Create an SSH tunnel** from your login node (or local machine) to the compute node.\n",
    "4. **Connect your VS Code notebook** (or browser) to the tunneled Jupyter URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow lets you offload computation to the compute node while using VS Code’s familiar interface for development and analysis."
